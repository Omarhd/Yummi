Hello there, just dummy app to show how real apps shold look like

so we used MVP Structure and scheme to create this app with best performance 

1- MVP: 

MVP Swift
Featured snippet from the web
MVP stands for Model View Presenter and is, at its core, an effective way to move much of the logic from your ViewController
files and instead replace it with a call to a presenter.
This means everything on your Presenter file is testable and easy to access and read.

Scheme:

The beginning of any new or existing iOS application development cycle should start off on the right foot.
A solid foundation to support each environment level within the configuration of the XCode project is a great first step to the success of your application.
This will allow the development team, continuous integration (CI) services, and QA to easily test/create builds for a particular environment.


. A typical application environment hierarchy may look like:
. Debug – Used by the development team
. Development – Lastest approved development source
. QA / UAT – Latest development source from the previous sprint
. Stable / Production – Tested and approved source for deployment
